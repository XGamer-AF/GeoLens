Yes, I can absolutely confirm that on your Windows Professional(Enterprise) package - it comes up with the option to host an unlimited number of domains and websites.

If you do not have the domain registered, you could start off and purchase it with us from your Client Area -> Domains -> Register a new domain to us.

If the domain is already registered from another place, you will just need to update its Nameserver record values to the following entries:
- ns1.win09.tmd.cloud
- ns2.win09.tmd.cloud


Once this is met, here are also the steps on how to add as much domains into your account as you want:

1. Log into your Plesk control panel at: https://win09.tmd.cloud:8443/
2. Navigate to the 'Websites & Domains' tab
3. Press on the button saying 'Add Domain'
4. Type in your the name of your domain without the 'www' prefix and then hit the 'OK' button at the bottom.

You can also refer to the following Plesk documentation which would illustrate and show you quite clearly how to add domains:
